# ReadySetCrypto Onchain_Analysis
Developing a Toolkit for On-chain analysis of Blockchains

## Purpose of Repo
This repo is intended to contain scripts to support the RSC on-chain analysis Masterclass.

The workflow of scripts and codes are as follows:

1. Establish API data links to relevant APIs for data (Coinmetrics, Messari, dcrdata etc)
2. Format specfic coins of interest into data arrays for analysis and manipulation (BTC and DCR to start)
3. Develop on-chain analysis metrics
4. Plot up in a similar format to Woobull Charts for application
